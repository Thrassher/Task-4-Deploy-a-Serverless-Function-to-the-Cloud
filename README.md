# Task-4-Deploy-a-Serverless-Function-to-the-Cloud
To understand serverless computing  by creating and deploying a simple cloud function (FaaS)  that executes code automatically when triggered — without managing any servers.

Step 1 :-  Create the Lambda Function
•	Log in to the AWS Management Console.
•	Search for Lambda and click Create function.
•	Choose Author from scratch.
•	Enter a function name (Task_4)
•	Runtime: Select Python 3.x (or any language you prefer).
•	Click Create function and wait for the success message.

Step 2 :- Add the Function Code
•	Scroll to the Code section.
•	Replace the default code with a simple test function, like printing “Hello from Lambda!”.
•	Click Deploy to save the changes.


Step 3 :- Configure a Trigger (Invoke Automatically)
Choose how your Lambda gets activated:
•	API Gateway: For an HTTP trigger (access via web browser)

Step 4 :- Test the Function
•	In the Lambda console, click Test
•	Create a new test event with default JSON
•	Click Invoke
•	Check the results and logs


Step 5 :- Test the Function Through Your Browser (HTTP URL)
1.	After adding the API Gateway trigger, go to the Triggers tab in your Lambda function.
2.	You will find an Invoke URL generated by API Gateway. It looks like:
https://9qgmx00tfi.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/default/Task_4
3.	Copy this URL.
4.	Open your web browser.
5.	Paste the URL into the address bar and hit Enter.
